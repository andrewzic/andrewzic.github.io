  I am a Bolton Research Scientist at the Australia Telescope National Facility, within Space & Astronomy, CSIRO. My research lies in precision pulsar timing and searches for ultra-low frequency gravitational waves, and in the astrophysics of Galactic radio transients. I am a P.I. of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array experiment searching for low-frequency gravitational waves, and a member of the VAST and CRAFT survey teams on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder.

  I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Space & Astronomy in 2020, on "Cool Stellar Activity at Low Radio Frequencies".
